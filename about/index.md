I receieved my BS in Mechanical Engineering from Columbia Engineering in 2016
and my MS in Biostatistics from Columbiaâ€™s Mailman School of Public Health in 2018. My
research interests include machine learning, novel statistical methodology, and market-related
data analytics.

In 2018,I joined Eli Lilly and Company where I work as a Senior Statistician. My work deals
primarily in clinical trials focusing on providing regression analysis, simulation research, and
data visualizations for the review of safety and efficacy of various compounds.

Outside of work I enjoy partaking in snowboarding, ultimate frisbee, fantasy football, and gaming.
